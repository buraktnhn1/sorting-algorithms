# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains fundamental sorting algorithm implementations 
developed in C++ as part of my Software Engineering studies.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Simple comparison-based algorithm

### 2. Selection Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Selects minimum element and places it in correct position

### 3. Merge Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Divide and Conquer strategy
- Recursive implementation

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Algorithm design
- Time complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
- Recursion
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Divide and Conquer approach
